        <p>Welcome. This is a short paragraph; others are not.</p>
        <p>
          If you are reading this on a <em>modern</em> web browser, it
          automatically uses modern JavaScript which is about 10x smaller and
          faster to load.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are reading this on a <em>legacy</em> web browser, it
          automatically falls back to older JavaScript, transpiled down from the
          original, to make sure it still works everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefit is that you can program for modern browsers and have them
          use the modern code. You don't have to transpile down everything to
          the lowest common denominator. Modern browsers get the fastest code!
